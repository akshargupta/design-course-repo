    "## 1. From Strings to Numbers: The Embedding Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "Computers cannot understand language. If you feed the string `\"cat\"` into a neural network, it sees nothing but a stream of ASCII bytes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"cat\" = [99, 97, 116]  # ASCII values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform mathematical operations on language (like computing attention), we must first convert these discrete symbols into continuous numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Old Way: One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, we represented words as sparse vectors with a single `1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cat:    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "Dog:    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "King:   [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Queen:  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "Apple:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** These vectors are **orthogonal** (90 degrees apart). The dot product between any two words is 0, which mathematically implies they share *zero* similarity. This is obviously wrong—\"Cat\" and \"Dog\" are both animals!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Modern Way: Dense Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "An **embedding** is a dense vector of floating-point numbers that represents the *semantic meaning* of a word:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Cat:   [0.82, -0.13, 0.51, -0.74, ...] # 768 dimensions\n",
    "Dog:   [0.79, -0.09, 0.48, -0.71, ...] # Similar to Cat!\n",
    "King:  [-0.21, 0.88, 0.05, 0.43, ...]\n",
    "Queen: [-0.19, 0.85, 0.08, 0.47, ...] # Similar to King!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this high-dimensional space:\n",
    "- Words with **similar meanings** point in **similar directions**\n",
    "- The **distance** between vectors encodes **semantic difference**\n",
    "- The **dot product** measures **semantic similarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation of every modern language model, including GPT, BERT, and transformers."

    "\n",
    "Now comes the critical question: **How do we measure if two words are similar?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is the **dot product** (also called the **inner product**). This is the *single most important operation* in attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\times b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \\cdots + a_n b_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [4, 5, 6]\n",

    "a · b = (1×4) + (2×5) + (3×6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32\n",

    "### Geometric Interpretation\n",

    "Once you pass all local tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review your code** to ensure it follows best practices\n",
    "2. **Submit to the API server** (instructions will be provided separately)\n",

    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",

    "- The geometric interpretation of transforming embedding space\n",

    "## 8. Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embeddings** represent words as dense vectors in high-dimensional space\n",
    "2. **Semantic similarity** is encoded as geometric proximity (distance and direction)\n",
    "3. The **dot product** measures how aligned two vectors are:\n",
    "   - High dot product = Similar meaning\n",
    "   - Low/zero dot product = Unrelated meaning\n",
    "   - Negative dot product = Opposite meaning\n",
    "4. **Vector arithmetic** (e.g., King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen) works because embeddings encode semantic relationships as geometric directions\n",
    "5. **Cosine similarity** normalizes the dot product to be between -1 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you learned today builds toward the attention mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $QK^T$ term computes dot products between:\n",
    "- **Q** (Query): \"What am I looking for?\"\n",
    "- **K** (Key): \"What information do I have?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Words with high dot products \"attend\" to each other!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, try these challenges:\n",
    "1. Modify the visualization to show 3 semantic clusters instead of 2\n",
    "2. Implement cosine similarity from scratch without using `np.linalg.norm`\n",
    "3. Create a function that finds the top-K most similar words to a given word\n",
