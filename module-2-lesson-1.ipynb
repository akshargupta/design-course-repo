    "1. **A point** in space (the coordinates)\n",
    "2. **An arrow** from the origin to that point (direction and magnitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- `[2, 3]` is a point in 2D space\n",
    "- `[1, 2, 3]` is a point in 3D space\n",
    "- `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.768]` is a point in 768D space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Vectors Matter for AI\n",

    "- An image: `cat.jpg → [0.23, 0.67, -0.12, ...]`\n",

    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vectors** are lists of numbers that can represent points in space\n",
    "2. **Vector spaces** are mathematical \"universes\" where vectors live\n",
    "3. **High-dimensional spaces** (768D, 1536D) give us capacity to encode complex semantic relationships\n",
    "4. **Embeddings** transform words into vectors where semantic similarity = geometric proximity\n",
    "5. **Euclidean distance** measures how far apart two vectors are\n",
    "6. Embeddings are **learned** by neural networks from massive text data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "You've taken the first step toward understanding attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Words → Vectors → Geometric Space → Similarity Measures → Attention\n",
    "  ^                                                          ^\n",
    " (This lesson)                                      (Module 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In the attention mechanism, we need to know **which words are related**. By representing words as vectors:\n",
    "- We can **measure** semantic relationships mathematically\n",
    "- We can **compute** which words should attend to each other\n",
    "- We can **learn** these representations from data\n",
